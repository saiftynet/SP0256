# In the beginning

In the beginning there was light.  Of course there was, but a bang must have followed shortly after. It is not unexpected that the communication between organisms, surrounded by a fluid whether it is air or water, is primarily acoustic rather than visual.  While vision remains the king of senses and chemical signals are ubiqitous, interaction using a oscillating pressure producer and a corresponding sensor remains the best compromise to create a versatile rich, abstracted, linear data transfer not requiring line of sight. or any other complex infrastucture apart from a medium that envelops the organism.  Thus, speech.  I recall the early days of my youth my ZXSpectrum had a [Currah Microspeech](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/zxsr.php?id=8067) module which, with only a 2K ROM, was able to produce an infinte number of raspy, but mostly recognisable words.  Flash-forwards to today, we have far more powerful utilities producing sounds almost indistinguishable from another human. and Perl allows access to these speech engines.  These are powerful, non-trivial utilities, with superior abilities to change intonnation, speed and other forms of expressive audio manipulations.  For those interested polease explore [PerlSpeak](https://metacpan.org/release/JKAMPHAUS/PerlSpeak-2.01/view/lib/PerlSpeak.pm), [Festival](https://metacpan.org/pod/Speech::Festival::Synthesiser), [e-Speak](https://metacpan.org/pod/Speech::eSpeak).  Perl is certainly not short of vocalising options.


# Pure Perl Implementation

As an old simpleton, however, I can not drag myself away from the genius of the guys who with such limited resources managed so much, into the modern world were memory and processor power limitations are of no real issue.  The SP0256-AL2 is the centre of this remarkable primitive utility, and I took it myself to explore how this worked, to transform it into a simple module that can be imported into any Perl program, with no dependencies apart from a means to transfer data to a speaker.  There indeed many attempts to emulate this little chip, though I have not come across any that specifically use Perl, I do find resources including this one from [Greg Kennedy](https://github.com/greg-kennedy/p5-NRL-TextToPhoneme) that allow translation to the allphones used here.

Now I did make a [Piano-like monophonic player](https://github.com/saiftynet/piano) (Enable the sound in the embedded video sample to hear), based on a memory of a similar utility I saw many years ago. Most web examples use /dev/dsp for audio transfer to the output device, but this virtual interface no longer exists.  A pipe to padsp does allow the emulation of /dev/dsp, and this is what I have used for Linux OS; Win32::Sound has a Windows equivalent of a sink for the raw audio data.
