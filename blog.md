# In the beginning

In the beginning there was light.  Of course there was, but a bang must have followed shortly after. It is not unexpected that the communication between organisms, surrounded by a fluid whether it is air or water, is primarily acoustic rather than visual.  While vision remains the king of senses and chemical signals are ubiqitous, interaction using a oscillating pressure producer and a corresponding sensor remains the best compromise to create a versatile rich, abstracted, linear data transfer not requiring line of sight. or any other complex infrastucture apart from a medium that envelops the organism.  Thus, speech.  I recall the early days of my youth my ZXSpectrum had a [Currah Microspeech](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/zxsr.php?id=8067) module which, with only a 2K ROM, was able to produce an infinte number of raspy, but mostly recognisable words.  Flash-forwards to today, we have far more powerful utilities producing sounds almost indistinguishable from another human. and Perl allows access to these speech engines.  These are powerful, non-trivial utilities, with superior abilities to change intonnation, speed and other forms of expressive audio manipulations.  For those interested polease explore [PerlSpeak](https://metacpan.org/release/JKAMPHAUS/PerlSpeak-2.01/view/lib/PerlSpeak.pm), [Festival](https://metacpan.org/pod/Speech::Festival::Synthesiser), [Speech Synthesis in Perl](https://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol3_4/tpj0304-0006.html).  Perl is certainly not short of vocal options.

As an old simpleton, however, I can not drag myself away from the genius of the guys who with such limited resources managed so much, into the modern world were memory and processor power limitations are of no real issue.  The SP0256-AL2 is the centre of this remarkable primitive utility, and I took it myself to explore how this worked, to transform it into a simple module that can be imported into any Perl program, with no dependencies apart from a means to transfer data to a speaker.  There bindeed many attemts to emulate this little chip
